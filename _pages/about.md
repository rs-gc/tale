We want to make people more **productive** by allowing them to do multiple things at the same time.

We want to allow people to read anything they are browsing, seeing or reading. We want to be in a position where the user should be able to hear the text rather than reading it.

If you want to learn something new but finding it hard to find time in your busy schedule then our app will help you to make a set routine helping you to attain your goals.

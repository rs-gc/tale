Sorry for missing week 2 updates for Pladio. In this post, we are going to share both week 2 and 3 updates. What we did last week and how much we achieved in the last two weeks.

**Learnings**

Learnings in week 3 were pretty clear. Most of our friends are not pretty active on LinkedIn. We shared the link with few of our friends and most of them even failed to login into the web or android app.

Either the message is not pretty intuitive or we are doing something wrong at this point. Either way, we will have to complete the cycle for our android or web app.

Currently, if the user is on his/her mobile phone, he is not able to complete the whole process. He/She can't really store the web pages directly to his/her profile.

To complete the cycle we are going to create a method for saving the web pages directly from the app using URL.

This will complete the cycle for a big set of users.

**Metrics**

`Number of Users gained:` 9


**Bugs**

In the last two weeks, we moved insecure `HTTP` to more secure `https`. All our APIs and web app have now been moved to https. Thanks to the effort made by our DevOps team.

We fixed a few bugs for medium users so that we can show proper images for them.

Looking forward to adding more users and increasing the use of the application in the general public.

Please share the application with your friends so that we can get to the number with far more ease.

Last week we shared a video for our users explaining how to use the stuff.

Here is the link to the video.
